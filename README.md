# Hadoop-matrix-multiplication
A Hadoop MapReduce implementation of matrix multiplication for distributed processing of large-scale matrices

## 1. Requirement
(1) Implement the matrix preprocessing algorithm and matrix multiplication algorithm using MapReduce;

(2) Display the running results step by step, i.e., display the initial matrix, the preprocessed matrix, and the result matrix of matrix multiplication;

(3) Demonstrate MapReduce multiplication using two matrices of different sizes to reach the limits of the computer.

## 2. Development Environment

• System: Windows 10, Hadoop 3.1.3

• IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.2

• Language: Java
